It\\\\u2019ll take around 3.5-4 hours to get to ORD and tickets around $40-$50 each way\\\\n\\\\nYou could also take the train, but it\\\\u2019s a bit more complicated, as Amtrak\\\\u2019s routes from Champaign to Chicago will end up you at Union Station in downtown. From there you\\\\u2019ll need to take the CTA blue line to the airport. It\\\\u2019s around a 2.5-3 hour train ride plus about 45 minutes on the CTA line. Amtrak tickets are much cheaper though, as they only cost around $15 if you book in advance (plus another $5 for the CTA ticket to the airport). You also have more limited timing options, as there are only 3 trains per day from Champaign to Chicago\\\\n\\\\nLastly, you could fly. There are two flights a day from Champaign to ORD, on American (but they\\\\u2019re operated by Envoy Air if that matters to you). Then you just take a connecting flight to EWR.

I\\'m so glad I have someone to relate to.. everyone just seems so set on their major and I feel so behind.\\\\n\\\\nThe thing with me and design is that I can imagine it, even with great detail, but I can\\'t put it to paper.

It sounds really interesting. Thanks for bringing it up\\\\n\\\\nAnd construction? Love it! The course outline for Arch studies seems a lot more design-based than what they advertise, which is a bit sad. The only structural\\\\/technical courses you would take are during your Sophomore year. The two years after that? Design studios. Arch studies at UIUC used to be Arch Engineering.

All of which are pretty good!\\\\n\\\\nLegends is a fun Illini themed dive bar with decent food, and Kams is our most popular \\\\\"nightclub\\\\\" esk student bar. Murphys is also a pretty relaxed pub with decent food. Illini Inn is a more neighborhood bar vibe and is nestled in Greek row again with decent food. \\\\n\\\\nWhile I personally enjoy Lion, I would steer clear of it! \\\\n\\\\nDowntown Champaign is also filled with really high-quality restaurants and isn\\'t too far from campus town.\",\"243\":\"Tailgate. It\\'s college football. Students tend not to tailgate because its expensive as a student if your parents aren\\'t paying, but as adults with adult income, all of you chipping in some money to tailgate shouldn\\'t be much of an issue. In reality, it probably costs a similar amount of money to send bars vs tailgate, but students are much happier spending that money purely on booze than on a tailgating setup lol. \\\\n\\\\nParking is $25 day of (might be $20 if you prepay, but I\\'ve never done it so idk how it works). If you have multiple cars, I recommend finding a random university lot with meters a ways away from the stadium and parking any additional cars there (most metered university lots are free on weekends) and taking a bus back to the stadium for free. That way you only pay for the one car and can just pay $5 per guy for parking. \\\\n\\\\nAs far as places to go, Green Street is great for students, but options are more limited for adults (most adults don\\'t want to go to a club-esque college bar and eat drunk student food after a game lol). The best options tho are likely Legends and Murphy\\'s. They\\'re both bars with food, and bar wise, much closer to a true bar while places like Kams or Lion are trying imitate more of nightclub vibes. Off campus tends to be where most people go out of college, specifically going to downtown Champaign. This is where the majority of good local resteraunts are at. There\\'s a lot of good ones from Blackdog. Guidos, Esquire Lounge, etc. Plus I think 1-2 breweries are in there as well if you\\'re into that. Never been to them tho. If you want more sitdown chain types of places, they\\'re scattered throughout town, but mostly located on and around Prospect Ave, north of 74.

It\\'s unlikely that anyone would notice if you applied to one program, *got rejected*, and then applied for another, but in principle, that information is visible to the admissions committee and CS faculty who know where to look.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m not certain what would happen in if you were *accepted* for spring admission to MCS and then applied for MSCS admission in the fall, but **my best guess is that your MSCS application would be automatically rejected**.\\\\n\\\\nYou are definitely not allowed to apply to more than one CS graduate program *at the same time.*  If you did submit simultaneous MCS and MSCS applications,  your MSCS application would be automatically rejected, and possibly your MCS applciation as well.  Similarly, if you already have a master\\'s degree in CS or a nearby field, you can\\'t be admitted to another master\\'s degree program in CS.\\\\n\\\\nBut like I said, I\\'m not certain whether your plan is allowed.

Don\\'t just take my pessimistic word for it!\\\\n\\\\nRegardless of what they tell you, my recommentation is that you decide which master\\'s degree you actually want, *and then apply only to that one*; don\\'t waste your time, or the admissions committee\\'s time, by applying to both.\\\\n\\\\n* If you want to do reserach, apply for MSCS (but remember that you won\\'t be admitted unless at least one professor declares that they\\'re willing to be your advisor).\\\\n* If you don\\'t want to do research (or you can\\'t identify a likely advisor) then apply for MCS.\\\\n\\\\nEither way, you should simultaneously apply to similar programs at half a dozen other universities, so that all your eggs aren\\'t in one basket.\\\\n\\\\nTo answer your final question: Yes, applications to MCS and MSCS both require three recommendation letters, a statement of purpose, and a complete set of transcripts.  Admission to the MCS program is based primarily on grades, as long as you have a decent computer science background.  Admission to the MS program requires some evidence of research potential to be visible in your statement and your rec letters.\",\"900\":\"Everyone I know got an A+ last semester.\",\"901\":\"Is this a rick roll\",\"902\":\"It was not\\\\n\\\\nThis is good\",\"903\":\"Super cool!!\",\"904\":\"I know right?!\",\"905\":\"I cant dm but i have the 3rd edition.

Scariest shit ever.\",\"1323\":\"General advice for bats in your house (I\\\\u2019ve had this happen in my house in Urbana twice in the last 10 years). \\\\n\\\\nIf it is flying around inside, quickly open an exterior door or window. The bat wants to get outside and is flying around trying to find an exit. They can sense the outside air and will leave. \\\\n\\\\nBats cannot fly for very long. They will land on a vertical surface like drapery or blinds. In both instances in my home they were brown bats and they clung to a dark brown fabric strip on the blinds. They can be very hard to spot. \\\\n\\\\nMost likely the bat is still in your apartment unless there was an open door or window. They don\\\\u2019t seem very good at returning through the small entrances they used to get into the house. \\\\n\\\\nBats are dangerous because of rabies. You can contract rabies even through minor contact with a bat (a scratch is sufficient, doesn\\\\u2019t have to be a bite). Untreated rabies in humans is nearly always fatal. You may want to go to student health services just in case. \\\\n\\\\nSo, this is a serious situation. You need to have someone come to your apartment and find the bat and how it got in. Even if you toss it out, it may try to regain access via the same method it originally entered (if the bats are nesting in an attic or crawl space adjacent to your apartment).\\\\n\\\\nI would not let the landlord blow off the situation.\",\"1324\":\"We used to regularly get bats in our house in Champaign. It\\\\u2019s almost impossible to find out how they get in, and as other posters have noted, they are really bad at leaving. They often enter low down but will always fly up to a higher floor if they can, and will end up in the southwest room\\\\u2014in our house, the master bedroom. If you can find them the next morning, animal control will remove them, usually by grabbing them bare-handed and stuffing them into a bag for later release. \\\\n\\\\nThe chances of a bat having rabies is very, very low (especially compared to other animals), but not zero. We thought our son might have been bitten, went to the doc who said, \\\\u201cnope. Not a bat bite,\\\\u201d and that was that. \\\\n\\\\nWe looked into having our house bat-proofed. It was like $20,000 ten years ago, which seemed absurd.

If you are lost on campus or in the area, find somewhere well lit and an MDT sign or stop.  The bus service is a great go-to in a pinch, and can either give you directions or possibly take you partway there.  They run all day and night.  Be aware they only stop on the side of the street of the sign, so if you miss one on the other side, wait a few minutes and one will be rolling up to your side. \\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019re on campus and near an open university office or admin building, those are also a halfway decent option, so long as you can find a faculty or staff member. \\\\n\\\\nGambling on the kindness of random strangers, especially if you are a woman, is extremely risky sober, much less inebriated.  \\\\n\\\\nAs far as police in this scenario go, only approach marked and obvious vehicles or officers.  I say this because of what happened to Yingying Zhang, who was lost and running late before a guy claiming to be an off duty cop offered her a ride.\\\\n\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t be afraid to call the campus police non-emergency number either:  (217) 333-1216\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGoogle Maps app can tell you MDT bus schedules and estimates of arrival.  \\\\n\\\\nUse your best judgment, and while 98% of folks in the C-U area are friendly and decent, that number is not 100.\",\"1366\":\"Big kudos to those guys!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nJust to give more info on SafeRides as someone else mentioned, here\\'s the link to MTD\\'s website with a page specifically about SafeRides (if you don\\'t want to click a link you can find the page by searching \\\\\"UIUC SafeRide\\\\\" in your browser):\\\\u00a0https:\\\\/\\\\/mtd.org\\\\/maps-and-schedules\\\\/uiuc-learn-to-ride\\\\/saferides\\\\/\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSafeRides are available OVERNIGHT even during times when the standard bus routes aren\\'t active, and are available until 6am during the fall and spring semesters. **There is no charge, you just show your iCard.** There are some limitations, such as SafeRides not being available far outside of standard bus route limits and not being available to pick up someone directly from a bar, but essentially if you can get to a bus stop or 24-hour university building or something within the specifications listed on the web page, they will pick you up.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUIUC also has SafeWalks available until 2:30am during the semester (search in your browser for \\\\\"UIUC SafeWalk\\\\\" if you don\\'t want to click this link:\\\\u00a0https:\\\\/\\\\/police.illinois.edu\\\\/services\\\\/safewalks\\\\/); again **there is no charge** for this either, they\\'ll send (I think 2, but I\\'m not sure) student patrol officers to walk with you to wherever you need to go. Student patrol officers aren\\'t police, although they can contact the police directly if something concerning or dangerous happens (i.e. if you\\'re being followed and threatened).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIt would also be good to memorize a couple of UIUC buildings that are open 24 hours a day, so if you need to get into a public space with people around quickly you have options. Grainger is usually open 24 hours a day on weekdays during regular semesters, you just need your iCard (I think your ID in the Illinois App would also be accepted) to enter the building after 10pm, and there\\'s Internet service and public computers there that you can use to contact someone to help you get home. Obviously it\\'s much less busy that late at night but there are still a few staff and faculty members around in case you really need immediate help and aren\\'t in a state to handle the situation alone.\",\"1367\":\"10 years ago a friend got jumped by a group when he was drunkenly stumbling home from Joes and he has facial nerve damage to this day.\",\"1368\":\"so so lucky.

They don\\\\u2019t have a list of what cars belong or not. They don\\\\u2019t make that call, and the threshold for making it is pretty high. The only instance in which a tow could be made from campus without the spot admin handling it is if it\\\\u2019s literally posing a hazard, ie blocking a fire lane or impeding traffic.\\\\n\\\\nFurther, you experienced an edge case and it sucks. But the vast majority of campus tows occur when someone knowingly places their car in a spot it does not belong and leaves it there so long that it has to be removed to allow others to do their job. The tow company has to pay a professional to move the car without damaging it; they have to be legally responsible for it to ensure it isn\\\\u2019t damaged or stolen while in their possession; and they have to have the staff to make it available to the right person upon request. They aren\\\\u2019t charging a ton because they are rolling in cash. They are charging because cars are expensive to move and guarantee.\",\"1558\":\"No, this is not correct for campus spots. I have seen a parking rental agreement for campus and the spot where you list people who are authorized to call a row.

The reason you saw many empty spots is because it\\\\u2019s someone\\\\u2019s job to keep the lot available for residents.

That\\\\u2019s just for the tow itself and these days probably on the low end. This isn\\\\u2019t some inflated fee.

They will do a certain number of sessions with you and then try to refer you out to somewhere else in the community. If you are looking to just try therapy short-term for a few sessions, or want help finding other mental health resources in town, it could definitely be useful. But if you are looking for something long term I would research other options.

If you\\'re looking to browse, it\\'s a little more challenging in a huge university library than at a bookstore or local library, but it can be done! The Main Stacks and the Literature and Languages Library are your best bets. \\\\n\\\\nIn the Library of Congress system, works of British literature are catalogued as PR (followed by a bunch of numbers) and works of US literature are catalogued as PS (followed by a bunch of numbers). Within those categories, books are arranged by broad chronological order, so the smallest numbers are generally works of or pertaining to the earliest literary periods, and the larger numbers are the most recent. Within each time period, the books are arranged by author\\'s last name. If you go to the actual library and find a map with all the locations of the Library of Congress numbers, you can usually find the vast array of shelves that have books you\\'d want to read. It\\'s still going to be challenging because works of scholarship and analysis are mixed in with the fiction (e.g., you\\'ll find all the books written ABOUT Toni Morrison and her novels alongside Sula, Beloved, Song of Solomon, etc.), but once you figure the pattern out, it gets easier to skim the shelves.\\\\n\\\\nA simple strategy is to think of a book that you\\'ve already read or are curious about), look it up in the catalog to get the LC number for it, and then go to that section of the library, where you\\'ll find other books from the roughly the same period.

They allow for people to find and make friends with others in the same situation. This ends up being great when large groups of people with the same end goal make a friend group and continue to help each other out. For example, the physics RSOs lean social, but all the people that show up find friends who will continue to work together in grad school applications, internship applications, etc.\",\"2977\":\"Gonna throw my hat into the ring here because this topic has always been interesting (and a bit frustrating, at the fault of nobody in particular) to me as a lead in both an engineering org targeted at women and an ACM SIG lead (obligatory disclaimer my opinions do not reflect my RSOs opinions, I\\\\u2019m speaking as an individual, etc). Women\\\\u2019s orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women\\\\u2019s orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don\\\\u2019t necessarily think it\\\\u2019s fair to expect the same level of depth from them. Let me explain what I mean.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s say the average freshman CS major can join one professional RSO before going crazy. To simplify, we\\\\u2019re gonna say that freshman CS majors can pick between ACM and WCS. ACM is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated, and WCS is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities. Let\\\\u2019s say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don\\\\u2019t necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let\\\\u2019s say 2\\\\/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1\\\\/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS\\\\u2019s job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don\\\\u2019t really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I\\\\u2019ve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I\\\\u2019ve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women\\\\u2019s engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I\\\\u2019d gotten more involved with them sooner. \\\\n\\\\nI will also say as a final note that I can\\\\u2019t speak for your individual experience on this (or WECE as an org), but in terms of discourse or drama, the grass is not always greener on the other side. I love both my RSOs and generally have no issues with them but the closer you get to the top of clubs like this, the more hard directional choices you have to make, the more you see go down, the more time you see wasted on stuff that doesn\\\\u2019t matter, etc. Regardless of the breadth of shenanigans I\\\\u2019ve seen over time, I wouldn\\\\u2019t trade the effort I\\\\u2019ve put into either of them for the world.\",\"2978\":\"If you want to join a women-focused RSO to learn more skills, join SWE or AOE (i can\\\\u2019t speak for AOE other than the women who I knew who joined it are awesome but SWE is very social but also has things like mock interviews, resume reviews, etc). I joined WECE specifically to meet my fellow women in ece because there were so few of us\\\\ud83d\\\\ude22I don\\\\u2019t think there\\\\u2019s anything wrong with WECE being more social focused - from what I saw, that\\\\u2019s why many people joined, so it makes sense to have a focus on social events.

(Not that it\\'s easy now, but it\\'s not as impossible-seeming.) I would recommend trying to do at least one social thing a week (or every two weeks, do what is most manageable to you) that is slightly outside of your comfort zone, such as greeting a classmate\\\\/hallmate\\\\/random person, or attending a campus event. This is essentially exposure therapy and it\\'ll slowly make it less intimidating to socialize with strangers. Making friends is just about impossible if you never initiate interactions (though some of my favorite friends were more extroverted people who did approach me first). This way, you can put yourself out there more and increase your chances of meeting someone you\\'re socially compatible with. It doesn\\'t guarantee friends, and I know it\\'s exhausting to socialize with random people and not \\\\\"get\\\\\" anything meaningful out of it like a friend, but it\\'s what\\'ll make it easier to make friends. Also, here\\'s a tip, [a study](https:\\\\/\\\\/www.apa.org\\\\/news\\\\/press\\\\/releases\\\\/2021\\\\/09\\\\/deep-conversations-strangers) published through the American Psychological Association found that, \\\\\"People overestimate awkwardness, underestimate enjoyment of deep, meaningful conversations\\\\\" (just bring up deep conversation topics with people, the majority of the time both you and the other person will enjoy it way more than you expected).\",\"4114\":\"One crazy simple trick to meeting people is leaving your dorm door open while you\\\\u2019re hanging out in there.

Also, most younger folks are surgically connected to their phone, but no one carries their NOAA radio to class or on a trip.\\\\n\\\\nAll of the cell phone warnings are super loud.

Strong storms of the type to form strong tornadoes generally do not cluster next to each other--there are usually gaps of a hundred or so miles, as they would otherwise compete with each other for moisture. A city is very small target to hit.\\\\n\\\\nWeak tornadoes from linear storms are actually far more common than you think, and sadly often unwarned due to lack of predictability.

      "\n",
      "**Overall Impression:** The overall aesthetic of the image is dark, moody, and artistic.  The contrast between the dark clothing of the dancers, the blue-lit forest backdrop, and the reflective floor creates a visually striking and dramatic scene. The image likely depicts a performance piece with a strong visual narrative.\n",

      "**Image Description:** A dynamic shot of the South Korean pop group BTS performing on stage.  The seven members are dressed in matching pastel yellow suits, with slight variations in style between members.  They are mid-performance, exhibiting energetic choreography.  The background is a muted, warm yellow.  The foreground shows a sea of enthusiastic fans, with many hands raised in the air. The overall mood is vibrant and celebratory.\n",

      "**Possible Annotations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Members (from left to right):**  This would require identifying each member individually, which can be challenging without specific knowledge of BTS.  Ideal annotations might include each member's stage name (e.g., RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, Jungkook) above their head.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Lighting:** Note the even, warm lighting across the scene, enhancing the yellow tones.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Setting:**  Identify the location as a concert stage.  Mention the relatively simple background, which allows the performers to be the focal point.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Overall Mood:** Label the image as depicting a lively, vibrant, and enthusiastic concert performance.\n",

      "\n",
      "To make this a truly effective annotation, specific member identification is needed, ideally supplemented with descriptions of the choreography and camera angle used.\n",

When looking at Jaime's degrees of centrality, he has a very high betweeness centrality, which could suggest that many people know or communicate wiht him."

However, the graph does a decent job depicting the closeness between each contestant as well as the friend groups that exist. It was hard to convert the graph because you can measure the closeness between each contestant based off of relationships, or you could measure their level on interaction on a friendship level, which could have been just as abundant."
